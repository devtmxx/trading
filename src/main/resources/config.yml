locales:
  # The directory where locales are stored. By default, locales are stored within the plugins data folder, but they can
  # exist anywhere on the machine. If the path starts with a '.' this will represent a relative path to the data folder,
  # otherwise it will be absolute.
  directory: './locales'

  # The default locale. This is used to search for translations if there is no suitable translation in the players
  # preferred locale.
  default: en_US

  # Lists the supported locales. If a players locale is not listed here, the translations will default to the specified
  # default locale.
